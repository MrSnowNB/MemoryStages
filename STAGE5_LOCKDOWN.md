# STAGE 5 LOCKDOWN: TUI/Ops Dashboard, Monitoring & Advanced Operations

**⚠️ STAGE 5 SCOPE ONLY - DO NOT IMPLEMENT BEYOND THIS BOUNDARY ⚠️**

## Prerequisites

- Stage 1 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- Stage 2 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- Stage 3 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- Stage 4 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- All Stage 1/2/3/4 tests pass with all feature combinations
- Stage 4 gate documented in `docs/STAGE_CHECKS.md`
- Python 3.10 environment

## Stage 5 Objectives (LOCKED SCOPE)

Implement **terminal-based operations dashboard** for secure administrative monitoring and manual operations while maintaining all existing safety guarantees:

✅ **IN SCOPE**:
- TUI or minimal web-based operations dashboard with local authentication
- Live monitoring of system health, feature flags, drift status, and audit metrics
- Manual trigger capabilities for heartbeat, drift scan, correction proposals, approvals
- Comprehensive event/audit log viewer with privacy-aware redaction controls
- Advanced maintenance tools with safe data injection and rollback capabilities
- Integration testing ensuring dashboard operations respect all existing constraints

🚫 **OUT OF SCOPE** (FUTURE STAGES):
- Agent or LLM integration for automated operations
- Remote API endpoints or external monitoring integrations
- Complex role-based access control or multi-user management
- Real-time notifications or alerting systems
- Advanced analytics or reporting beyond basic log viewing
- External database connections or backup services
- Cloud-based monitoring or dashboard hosting
- Complex state management or workflow engines

## Critical Constraints (ANTI-DRIFT SAFEGUARDS)

### Behavioral Constraints
- **All existing Stage 1/2/3/4 behavior preserved** when dashboard features disabled
- **SQLite remains canonical source of truth** - dashboard provides read/trigger interfaces only
- **No direct database queries from UI** - must use exposed, validated interfaces only
- **Privacy and sensitive data protection maintained** throughout dashboard operations
- **Feature flags and tombstone rules respected** in all dashboard interactions

### Implementation Constraints
- **Python 3.10 compatibility required**
- **Minimal dependencies** - Textual for TUI or simple Flask/FastAPI for web only
- **Local-only authentication** - no external auth services or complex sessions
- **No schema changes** outside explicitly allowed interface extensions
- **Dashboard operations must be auditable** - all actions logged to episodic events

## Environment and Configuration Flags

### Required Configuration Variables (.env)
```bash
# Operations Dashboard Controls (default: disabled)
DASHBOARD_ENABLED=false           # Master switch for ops dashboard
DASHBOARD_TYPE=tui                # tui|web (TUI preferred for local ops)
DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN=             # Local admin token (required when enabled)
DASHBOARD_SENSITIVE_ACCESS=false  # Allow viewing sensitive data with confirmation
DASHBOARD_MAINTENANCE_MODE=false  # Enable advanced maintenance tools

# Existing Stage 1/2/3/4 flags (unchanged)
APPROVAL_ENABLED=false
HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=false
VECTOR_ENABLED=false
SEARCH_API_ENABLED=false
DB_PATH=./data/memory.db
DEBUG=true
```

### Dashboard Access Control Matrix
| DASHBOARD_ENABLED | DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN | DASHBOARD_SENSITIVE_ACCESS | Behavior |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| false | * | * | **Stage 1/2/3/4 identical** - no dashboard |
| true | unset | * | **INVALID** - requires auth token |
| true | set | false | Basic monitoring and triggers only |
| true | set | true | **Full access** including sensitive data viewing |

### Dashboard Operation Modes
- **Read-only monitoring**: System health, feature flags, basic statistics
- **Safe triggers**: Manual heartbeat, drift scan, correction proposals
- **Administrative access**: Approval decisions, sensitive data viewing
- **Maintenance mode**: Advanced tools, data injection, index rebuilds

## File Touch Policy (STRICT)

**⚠️ STAGE 5 LOCKDOWN COMPLETE - NO IMPLEMENTATION BEYOND THIS SCOPE ⚠️**

This document defines the complete, gated execution plan for Stage 5. Upon successful completion of all slices and gates, Stage 5 will provide comprehensive administrative capabilities while maintaining all security, privacy, and educational guarantees established in foundational stages.

---

## Post-Completion Note

**Stage 5 implementation completed and validated on 2025-10-01.**

**Implementation Details:**
- TUI dashboard implemented using textual==0.38.1 (as specified in requirements.txt)
- All dashboard features (auth, monitoring, triggers, audit viewer, maintenance tools) implemented within Stage 5 scope
- Local authentication using DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable
- Comprehensive audit logging for all administrative operations
- Privacy controls maintained throughout (sensitive data redaction by default, explicit reveal with confirmation)

**Deviations:**
- Chose TUI implementation over web dashboard as preferred for local administrative operations
- All security specifications met (constant-time token comparison, comprehensive audit logging)
- File touch policy strictly adhered to - only tui/, scripts/, tests/, docs/, Makefile, requirements.txt modified

**No changes beyond Stage 5 scope were implemented.** All administrative actions are logged to episodic events. Dashboard default disabled in production (.env DASHBOARD_ENABLED=false).
