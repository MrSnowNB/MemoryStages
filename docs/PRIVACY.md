# MemoryStages Privacy Guarantees and Compliance Procedures

## Overview

MemoryStages implements comprehensive privacy controls to protect sensitive data throughout the system lifecycle. This document outlines our privacy guarantees, data handling procedures, and compliance verification processes.

## Data Classification

### Sensitive Data Categories

**Private Fields:**
- `value`: Core key-value data content
- `data`: Generic payload data
- `payload`: API request/response payloads
- `content`: Document or content data
- `secret`: Authentication secrets
- `password`: User passwords or credentials
- `token`: Authentication tokens
- `auth_token`: OAuth or API tokens
- `session_key`: Session identifiers
- `credential`: Authentication credentials

**Privacy Protection Levels:**

| Protection Level | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Redacted** | Always hidden, never exposed | Sensitive KV values |
| **Audited** | Access logged and controlled | Backup operations |
| **Isolated** | Separate processing paths | Vector indexing exclusions |

## Privacy Protections

### Core Privacy Mechanisms

**Default Redaction:**
- Sensitive data fields are automatically redacted in logs and exports
- Non-sensitive data remains accessible for debugging and monitoring
- Redaction occurs at the data access layer before transmission

**Access Control:**
- Sensitive data access requires explicit authorization
- All access attempts are comprehensively logged
- Administrative override requires explicit confirmation and audit trail

**Audit Trail:**
- Every sensitive data access is recorded with context
- Audit logs cannot be modified after creation (immutable design)
- Audit trail integrity is monitored and validated

## Privacy Procedures

### System Operation Privacy Controls

**When Privacy Enforcement is Disabled:**
- No access controls or auditing performed
- Sensitive data handling relies on existing application logic
- Default system behavior unchanged from earlier stages

**When Privacy Enforcement is Enabled:**

1. **Access Authorization:**
   ```bash
   # Sensitive operations trigger privacy validation
   validate_sensitive_access("accessor_id", "data_type", "reason_for_access")
   ```

2. **Automatic Redaction:**
   ```bash
   # Sensitive fields automatically redacted
   output = redact_sensitive_for_backup(data, include_sensitive=False)
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Audit:**
   ```bash
   # All privacy operations logged
   privacy_audit_summary()  # Generates compliance report
   ```

### Backup and Recovery Privacy

**Automated Backup Redaction:**
- Sensitive fields are redacted by default in backups
- Admin confirmation required to include sensitive data
- All backup operations are audited and logged

**Recovery Privacy Controls:**
- Recovery operations respect the same privacy controls
- Sensitive data inclusion requires explicit authorization
- Recovery operations are fully audited

## Audit Procedures

### Privacy Audit Execution

**Automated Privacy Audit:**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive privacy compliance report
from src.core.privacy import privacy_audit_summary

report = privacy_audit_summary()
print(f"Status: {report['status']}")
print(f"Findings: {len(report['findings'])}")
print(f"Recommendations: {report['recommendations']}")
```

**Audit Report Contents:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | ISO-formatted audit timestamp |
| `version` | System version at audit time |
| `privacy_enforcement` | Whether privacy controls are active |
| `audit_level` | Audit detail level (standard/verbose) |
| `findings` | Identified privacy issues/concerning patterns |
| `metrics` | Quantitative privacy statistics |
| `recommendations` | Suggested privacy improvements |

### Audit Findings Types

**System Configuration Issues:**
- Debug mode exposing sensitive data
- Incorrect privacy flag configuration
- Missing audit logging

**Data Compliance Issues:**
- High proportion of sensitive data
- Inadequate data classification
- Database connectivity problems

**Operational Issues:**
- Failed privacy controls
- Audit system malfunctions
- Unauthorized access attempts

### Risk Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Active privacy breach | Immediate response |
| **High** | High-risk configuration | < 24 hours |
| **Medium** | Policy violation | < 7 days |
| **Low** | Best practice recommendation | < 30 days |

## Privacy Violation Response

### Immediate Response Procedures

**Critical Severity Violations:**
1. **Isolate Exposure:** Immediately disable affected systems

**High Severity Violations:**
1. **Review Configuration:** Verify all privacy controls are active
2. **Audit Recent Activity:** Check for additional exposure
3. **Implement Safeguards:** Apply additional controls if needed
4. **Monitor:** Increased audit logging for suspect activities

### Recovery and Remediation

**Data Recovery:**
- Use verified backup procedures respecting privacy controls
- Apply redaction rules during recovery operations
- Validate recovered data privacy compliance

**System Restoration:**
- Re-enable privacy enforcement before system activation
- Verify all privacy controls functioning post-recovery
- Perform immediate privacy audit after restoration

## Compliance Verification

### Regular Compliance Testing

**Daily Checks:**
- System health monitoring includes privacy status

- Recovery process is fully audited

**Service Continuity:**
- Redundant systems maintain same privacy controls
- Failover procedures include privacy verification
- All recovered services submit to privacy audit before activation

This privacy framework ensures comprehensive protection while maintaining operational efficiency. Privacy controls are designed to be enable-able without disrupting existing functionality when disabled, providing flexibility for different deployment environments.
