# STAGE 6 LOCKDOWN: Privacy, Backup, and Maintenance

**⚠️ STAGE 6 SCOPE ONLY - DO NOT IMPLEMENT BEYOND THIS BOUNDARY ⚠️**

## Prerequisites

- Stage 1 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- Stage 2 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- Stage 3 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- Stage 4 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- Stage 5 is **COMPLETE** and **HUMAN-APPROVED**
- All Stage 1/2/3/4/5 tests pass with all feature combinations
- Stage 5 gate documented in `docs/STAGE_CHECKS.md`
- Python 3.10 environment

## Stage 6 Objectives (LOCKED SCOPE)

Implement **robust privacy controls, backup/restore workflows, and maintenance routines** while maintaining all existing safety and privacy guarantees:

✅ **IN SCOPE**:
- Enhanced privacy enforcement with automated and manual audit capabilities
- Local backup and restore pipelines with encryption and selective data controls
- Automated maintenance routines for database integrity and vector validation
- Compliance testing and privacy regression verification across all stages
- Comprehensive documentation for recovery, rollback, and compliance procedures
- Data protection audit trails and sensitive data access controls

🚫 **OUT OF SCOPE** (FUTURE STAGES):
- Remote or cloud-based backup services
- LLM, agent, or orchestration integration for automated maintenance
- External compliance reporting or third-party audit integrations
- Complex encryption key management or PKI systems
- Real-time monitoring or alerting for compliance violations
- Multi-tenant or role-based privacy controls
- Network-based backup or synchronization
- Automated privacy policy generation or legal compliance automation

## Critical Constraints (ANTI-DRIFT SAFEGUARDS)

### Behavioral Constraints
- **All existing Stage 1/2/3/4/5 behavior preserved** when Stage 6 features disabled
- **SQLite remains canonical source of truth** - backup/restore maintains data integrity
- **No schema changes** outside explicitly allowed interface extensions
- **Privacy and sensitive data protection enhanced** not replaced or weakened
- **Local-first operation maintained** - no external services or network dependencies

### Implementation Constraints
- **Python 3.10 compatibility required**
- **Minimal dependencies** - sqlite-utils, standard library, cryptography for local encryption only
- **Feature flags control all behavior** - privacy/backup/maintenance dark by default
- **Reversible operations only** - all maintenance and backup actions must be undoable
- **Comprehensive audit logging** - all privacy and maintenance operations logged

## Environment and Configuration Flags

### Required Configuration Variables (.env)
```bash
# Privacy and Maintenance Controls (default: disabled)
PRIVACY_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED=false    # Enhanced privacy controls
PRIVACY_AUDIT_LEVEL=standard         # minimal|standard|verbose
BACKUP_ENABLED=false                 # Local backup capabilities
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true      # Encrypt backups (default: true when enabled)
BACKUP_INCLUDE_SENSITIVE=false      # Include sensitive data in backups
MAINTENANCE_ENABLED=false           # Automated maintenance routines
MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE_SEC=86400      # Daily maintenance (24 hours)

# Existing Stage 1/2/3/4/5 flags (unchanged)
DASHBOARD_ENABLED=false
APPROVAL_ENABLED=false
HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=false
VECTOR_ENABLED=false
SEARCH_API_ENABLED=false

| PRIVACY_ENFORCEMENT_ENABLED | BACKUP_ENABLED | BACKUP_INCLUDE_SENSITIVE | Behavior |
|------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|----------|
| false | false | * | **Stage 1/2/3/4/5 identical** - no Stage 6 features |
| true | false | * | Enhanced privacy only, no backup |
| true | true | false | **Recommended** - privacy + backup without sensitive data |
| true | true | true | **Full backup** - requires admin confirmation, always audited |

### Maintenance Operation Levels
