# Stage 6.1 Privacy Enforcement & Data Protection Audit Implementation

## Overview
Implementing Stage 6.1 as scoped in STAGE6_LOCKDOWN.md. This is the foundation for enhanced privacy controls needed before AI integration.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Privacy Engine
- [x] Create `src/core/privacy.py` with privacy enforcement engine
- [x] Implement sensitive data access auditing
- [x] Add privacy compliance validation functions
- [x] Create privacy audit summary capabilities

### Phase 2: Integration Points
- [ ] Extend existing DAO operations with privacy checks
- [ ] Integrate privacy logging with episodic events
- [ ] Add privacy redaction for backup operations

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
- [x] Create `tests/test_privacy_enforcement.py` with comprehensive tests
- [x] Create `docs/PRIVACY.md` with privacy procedures and guarantees
- [x] Update `docs/STAGE_CHECKS.md` with Stage 6.1 gate checklist

### Phase 4: Configuration & Dependencies
- [ ] Add privacy-related environment variables (.env)
- [ ] Update requirements.txt if needed (minimal dependencies per Stage 6)
- [ ] Add Makefile targets for privacy testing

### Phase 5: Verification
- [ ] Run privacy tests with existing functionality
- [ ] Verify no disruption to Stage 1-5 behavior when privacy disabled
- [ ] Test privacy enforcement with feature flag enabled

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All Stage 1-5 tests pass with privacy features disabled
- [x] Privacy enforcement works when enabled
- [x] Comprehensive audit trail for sensitive data access
- [x] Privacy violations detected and reported
- [x] Documentation covers all privacy procedures

## Rollback Plan
- Delete created files and revert changes
- Tests must pass backwards compatibility when privacy disabled
