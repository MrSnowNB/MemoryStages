## Overview
Enhance system with heartbeat/sync/consistency, monitoring/telemetry, robust backup/restore, episodic memory foundation, resilience/qa, and comprehensive documentation to prepare for Stage 5 advanced memory.

## Implementation Areas

### 1. Heartbeat, Sync, and Consistency Layer
**Goal:** Ensure KV and FAISS stores always remain in sync through automated background processes
